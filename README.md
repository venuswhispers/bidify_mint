# Mint
Bidify Mint webapp, controls the minting of new NFT assets on multiple chains.

Bidify Mint is a simple easy to use platform/application for minting NFTs on various L1 Blockchains such as Avalanche and Ethergem.

Bidify Mint has been created to be a dedicated MFT minting platform to streamline the process for users and focus purely on turning an image into an immutable IPFS hosted NFT.

The platform will work by showing a simple familiar dialogue to allow a user to upload an image, add title and description and then chose a network to mint on, this will come at a fee including network fee. At this point users will be able to automatically add the NFT to the Bidify auction platform. See the user flow diagram below.

In the future Bidify mint will be a standalone app for Android and iOS, aswell as having various licences for users to select when creating an NFT to decide upon who owns the rights plus a full suite of tutorials will be available.
